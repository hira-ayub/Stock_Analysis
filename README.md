## Summary:

Essentially editing the existing code to determine if it will run faster than the one with all the stocks analysis. For it to properly work, it needs to be done in small steps, the steps are completed without major changes to existing code. Creating the 3 variable and defining the index help with the speed process.

### Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring Code:

The script run faster with the refactored code, but you can potentially introduce bugs that your tests will not catch. You can accidently remove something or paste a redundant code.

### Advantages & Disadvantages of The Original & Refactored Code:

Refactoring the original code splitting up and labeling its functions will benefit, It easier to make it readable by adding more comments for us or whomever wants to use the code in the future. Since run times is shorter, it boosts the system's performance.
